Project 1: Number Guessing Game
{
  Objective: Create a simple game where the computer picks a random number, and the user tries to guess it.

  Project Requirements:
    - The program will generate a random number between 1 and 20.
    - The user will have 5 chances to guess the number.
    - After each guess, the program will tell the user if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
    - If the user guesses the number correctly within the 5 tries, display a success message.
    - If the user fails to guess the number after 5 tries, reveal the correct number.
    - Make sure to use while or for loops and if statements to handle the logic.


  Example Flow:

  Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
  I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.

  You have 5 tries to guess it.
  Guess #1: 10
  Too low!
  Guess #2: 15
  Too high!
  Guess #3: 12
  Correct! You guessed the number in 3 tries.
  
  
  
  - This project is simple and perfect for beginners, as it helps them practice basic concepts like
  loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

Project 2: Simple Shopping List
{
  Objective: Create a program that allows the user to create and manage a basic shopping list.

  Project Requirements:
    - Allow the user to add items to the shopping list.
    - Provide an option to remove items from the list.

  - This project is simple but teaches how to work with lists, user input, and basic loops, which
  are great fundamentals.
